# Usagi
A cute Discord moderation bot in Node.js, using the Discord.js library.

Usagi can manage written warnings, chat muting and unmuting, display historical moderation actions, kick, ban and unban users. In addition, Usagi comes with a few catered utility functions (list of tone tags, a mood tracker, and a custom information command).

Data is persisted using quick.db.
